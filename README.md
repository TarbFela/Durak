**GAMEPLAY:
**
Run the script

When prompted for input, you will be shown you hand and then your options. Your options are numbered. Enter the corresponding number to take the corresponding action.

NOTE ABOUT "FORFEIT": as an attacker, you will have to forfeit every turn. Forfeiting without playing a card will end the round on your terms; forfeiting otherwise simply prompts the defender to take action.

DEFENDER: you are always defending against the **top** card in the open attacks readout.


**The rules are simple:
**
Goal of the game: run out of cards once the deck has been drawn down all the way

Rounds:

  There is an attacker (A) and defender (D)
  
  The attacker may attack by matching the face-value of any card which is in play. To start, the attacker may choose any card from the hand. The attacker may play multiple cards at once, granted they are of the same face-value.
  
  However, the attacker may not attack with more cards than the defender has. E.g., if the attacker has four Kings but the defender is holding two cards, the attacker may only play up to two of those Kings.

  
  
  If at any point (bar the first move of the round) the attacker is unable or unwilling to play a card, all of the cards in play are discarded. The roles are reversed and a new round begins.
  
  The defender must defeat each attack by matching the suit and exceeding the face-value, or by using a trump card (see below).
  
  If at any point the defender is unable or unwilling to play a card, all of the cards in play are picked up by the defender. A new round begins, but the roles are NOT reversed/



  At the end of the round, all players must draw from the deck until their hands each have six cards. The attacker always draws first, and to completion.



Once the deck runs out, gameplay continues until a player runs out of cards. If the attacker runs out of cards and the defender runs out of cards in the same exchange, there is no winner.



Trump cards:

  At the beggining of the game, the trump card is chosen from the bottom of the deck and is revealed. It is still part of the deck.
  
  The suit of the trump card is the trump suit.
  
  Trump-suited cards may be played against any other (non-trump) card and will beat them.
  
  Defending against trump-suited cards is the same as defending against other suits.
